            <h2 id="about">About</h2>
            <p>Albert Hofmann was a Swiss scientist known for being the first person to synthesize and ingest lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). He was also the first person to isolate the compound psilocybin which is found in magic mushrooms</p>
            <h2 id="discovery">Discovery of LSD</h2>
            <p>Hofmann was an employee at Sandoz Laboratories where he began to study the fungus ergot in an effort to purify and synthesize active components for use in pharmaceuticals. While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on 16 November 1938. The project was set aside for 5 years until 16 April 1943 when Hofmann decided to examine it further. While synthesizing the LSD, he accidentally ingested a small amount and discovered its powerful. As hofmann himself stated</p>
            <blockquote>
                ... affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated[-]like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Three days later, on 19 April 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. This day is known as "Bicycle Day" because he began to feel the effects of the drug as he rode home on a bike.

            <p>
                Hofmann continued to take small doses of LSD throughout much of his life and always hoped to find a use for it. In his memoir he emphasised it as a "sacred drug"
