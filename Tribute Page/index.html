			<h2>About</h2>
			<p id="tribute-info">Albert Hofmann was a Swiss scientist known for being the first person to synthesize and ingest lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). He was also the first person to isolate the compound psilocybin which is found in magic mushrooms</p>
		</article>
		<article id="discovery">
			<h2>Discovery of LSD</h2>
			<p>Hofmann was an employee at Sandoz Laboratories where he began to study the fungus ergot in an effort to purify and synthesize active components for use in pharmaceuticals. While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on 16 November 1938. The project was set aside for 5 years until 16 April 1943 when Hofmann decided to examine it further. While synthesizing the LSD, he accidentally ingested a small amount and discovered its powerful effects as stated in his book titled 'LSD - My problem child'.</p>
			<blockquote>
				April 16,1943, I was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the
				middle of the afternoon and proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness,
				combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant
				intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a
				dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I
				perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense,
				kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away.

			<h2>Bicycle day</h2>
			<p>
			Three days later, on 19 April 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. This day is known as "Bicycle Day" because he began to feel the effects of the drug as he rode home on a bike.
			<blockquote>
				 By now it was already clear to me that LSD had been the cause of the
				remarkable experience of the previous Friday, for the altered perceptions were of the
				same type as before, only much more intense. I had to struggle to speak intelligibly. I
				asked my laboratory assistant, who was informed of the self-experiment, to escort me
				home. We went by bicycle, no automobile being available because of wartime restrictions
				on their use.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
			Hofmann continued to take small doses of LSD throughout much of his life and always hoped to find a use for it. In his memoir he emphasised it as a "sacred drug"
